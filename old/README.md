# Please note
when i started this project, i was pretty bad at code caving and most of the techniques. 
i have gotten better thats why im starting fresh by reversing the base game.

# CubedWorld
Cube world is a fan project for creating a modding API for the acclaimed game 'Cube World' that has "Died" out and seems to not have updates any more until the year 2251, so we decided to try to create our own updates.

Status
======
Extremely early alpha, this stage is about getting all that we can to create a skeleton of what the api might be and by searching the game for calls that may be useful...

Why
======
Our poor fan favourite game is dying, no matter how we see it. The master-piece is going, so i and hopefully other developers will help me decompile and create a API like application that will allow us to make more use of this game and breath more life into it and bring it back to the market, the game may only be obtainable from pirating it but if the game is successful, I'm sure Picroma will reopen the store.

Pirating?
You didn't here it for me, I'm just implying the store is closed and you cant buy it.

Functions/Offsets
======
The list of found offsets/functions are located in Offsets.csv
